# Portfolio v2
Welcome to my portfolio site project! This README file will guide you through the project setup and provide an overview of its structure.

## Project Description
This project is a portfolio website created using React JS. It showcases my job experience, education qualifications, projects I've worked on, and list of my skills.

## Getting Started
How to clone and run project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chavda2772/Portfolio-v2.0.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd Portfolio_v2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```command
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and view the website in your browser, use:

```command
npm run dev
```

This will open the project in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
